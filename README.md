# Village

This is an old computer science project worked on for school.

The [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) software design pattern is used, 
as can be seen whereby three directories distinguish between the model, view, and controller. They are accurately
named as such as well.

Although initially it was supposed to be created with a text view, I thought this too primitive for
my outlook on what the game should actually be, and the functionality I don't think would have worked. At least,
it would have been too complex to create. That's why instead it features a textured display of the game.

Finally, two directories are classified as client and server, which satisfied the requirement for employing
the [client/server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model) application structure.


Please use Village for educational purposes if need be, but do not copy this for homework assignments.
